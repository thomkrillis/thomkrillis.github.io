                        My name is Bobby Yankou. The name Thom Krillis was born a few years ago when I audited a course on interactive design and had to create my first <a href="https://github.com/thomkrillis">Github</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomKrillis">Twitter</a> accounts. I did not want to use my actual name, since at the time I did not know what I would end up doing with these accounts. Eventually, I started to use the Github account professionally, and the fake name has stuck.

For the last couple of years of my life, I have been working part-time at <a href="http://www.thehackerati.com/">The Hackerati</a> as a software engineer.
